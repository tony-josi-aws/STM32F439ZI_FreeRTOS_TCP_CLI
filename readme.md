# FreeRTOS Kernel + TCP/IP Stack CLI 

This project is a demo integration of the FreeRTOS Kernel and the FreeRTOS + TCP/IP (IPv4 for now) stack with FreeRTOS CLI over UDP on the STM32F439ZI NUCLEO board.

## Using CubeMX or .ioc file in the project

The Ethernet interface is completely decoupled from the auto generated code provided by the CubeIDE via .ioc file as we are using the NetworkInterface provided Eth init; hence the Ethernet interface is disabled in the .ioc file to disable unnecessary code being generated by the CubeIDE.

he hardware initialization part of the Ethernet is done in the `HAL_ETH_MspInit` and `HAL_ETH_MspDeInit` functions of the app_main.c which are copied versions of the CubeIDE generated code.
